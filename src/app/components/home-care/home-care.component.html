        <p>
            Qualified, professional, trustworthy, kind, and dependable. We treat all of our
            patients as individuals, and we understand that we’re only as good as the caregivers who work with us and
            who
            serve our clients in care. We are pleased to serve clients throughout the Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re serious about the service we provide to seniors and others in our care. We’re diligent when it comes
            to
            checking references of potential caregivers — no employee is ever engaged until they undergo a thorough
            screening process which includes a Criminal Reference Check, and all new caregivers must be bonded and
            insured
            by the Worker Compensation Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            We appreciate the responsibility that comes with our very hands-on role of client care. We are proud to
            offer
            our services to clients across various provinces in Canada.
            We
            know that when we treat our care providers with kindness and respect, it will be reflected in the care they
            provide for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our employees have set an enviable standard for live-in caregivers that has garnered much
            praise from our clients. They offer a true level of consistency and comfort with the elederly on
            rotation, and they really become part of the family.
